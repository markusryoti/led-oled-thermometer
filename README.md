# Arduino thermometer

Simple implementation of a room thermometer with I2C OLED 0.96" (128Ã—64) display and DS18B20 temperature sensor. Temperature is presented in the display but there's also an RGB led that changes color from blue to red according to the temperature. The color change is done logarithmically.
